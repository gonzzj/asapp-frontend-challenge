# ASAPP Front End Challenge

In these files, you'll find the API needed to work on the ASAPP Front End
Challenge. You should have an email with the challenge details.

To run the API you'll need a version of Node and NPM with `npx` (Node 8+). Then
run `api-server` (for a \*nix like environment) or `api-server.bat` (for
Windows).

Once that the server starts, it will be listening at http://localhost:3030

The API reference is also available at http://localhost:3030/help

> **Note:** This API was created for the challenge, and is not a battle-tested
> production API. If you find a bug or issue that prevents you from doing the
> challenge contact us as soon as possible.
